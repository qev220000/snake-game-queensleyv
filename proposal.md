## Description
I will be making a snake game using pygame. This is relevant as it is one 
of the original games typically thought of when thinking of simple 
computer games
## Features
- Moving Snake
	- similar to the rain drops and will be controlled via the arrow keys
- Collectibles
	- when touched will dissapear and be added to a counter on the screen for points
- Different colors of maps and collectibles
	- User input will ask what they want the map to look like and will change based on the
    response

## Challenges
- How to make the snake follow user input from arrow keys
- How to make sure the snake grows after collecting a collectible
- How to change the color of the map and collectibles and keep it consistent and able to 
be changed every round

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Fully functioning snake game that is able to be customized and has the correct
functions for a typical snake game

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- snake is able to move around and at least recognize when it touches a collectible


## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. create the sprite for the snake
  2. create the map for the snake

- Week 2
  1. create the collectibles
  2. make the snake able to grow from collecting collectibles

- Week N (Final)
  1. finish off any bugs with the game functions like getting collectibles
  and being able to die from running into walls or itself
  2. be able to customize the map and collectibles to different
  colors
