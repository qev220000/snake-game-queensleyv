## Description
I followed multiple tutorials to create a snake game.
This games objective is to move the snake around using the
arrow buttons in order to collect fruits to make the snake longer.
But watch out becuase if you hit yourself or the walls its game
over and you get reset.

This project used different files including graphics and sounds
that have also been pushed into the repository for others to use.

I wanted to make sure the game wasnt identical to typical snake games
so I used my favorite color purple for the background and chose a new 
design for the fruits.

The way I made the project my own was adding the randomization of the
fruits from 3 different options and the randomization continues until
you choose to move the snake.

In the future I'd like to add the option to use buttons in order to 
choose the specific type of fruit one would like to play with instead
of having to use randomization.

I used the following videos to help me make my project
